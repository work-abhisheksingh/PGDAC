# Software Engineering

## What is 'Software Engineering' ?

Definition: Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. Software engineering was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. It ensures that the application is built consistently, correctly, on time and on budget and within requirements. The demand of software engineering also emerged to cater to the immense rate of change in user requirements and environment on which application is supposed to be working.


## Why Software Engineering? Software Crisis & its Solution:


## What was the Software Crisis?
- Many software became over budget. Output was an unreliable software which is expensive to maintain.
- Larger software was difficult and quite expensive to maintain.
- Lots of software not able to satisfy the growing requirements of the customer.
- Complexities of software projects increased whenever its hardware capability increased.
- Demand for new software increased faster compared with the ability to generate new software.


## Why Software Engineering is Popular?

- Large software – In our real life, it is quite more comfortable to build a wall than a house or building. In the same manner, as the size of the software becomes large, software engineering helps you to build software.
- Scalability- If the software development process were based on scientific and engineering concepts, it is easier to re-create new software to scale an existing one.
- Adaptability: Whenever the software process was based on scientific and engineering, it is easy to re-create new software with the help of software engineering.
- Cost- Hardware industry has shown its skills and huge manufacturing has lower the cost of the computer and electronic hardware.
- Dynamic Nature– Always growing and adapting nature of the software. It depends on the environment in which the user works.
- Quality Management: Offers better method of software development to provide quality software products.

## Characteristics of Good Software

Any software should be judged by what it offers and what are the methods which help you to use it.

Every software must satisfy the following attributes:

- Operational
- Transitional
- Maintenance
Here are some important characteristics of good software developed by software professionals

### Operational
This characteristic let us know about how well software works in the operations which can be measured on:

- Budget
- Efficiency
- Usability
- Dependability
- Correctness
- Functionality
- Safety
- Security


### Transitional

This is an essential aspect when the software is moved from one platform to another:

- Interoperability
- Reusability
- Portability
- Adaptability


### Maintenance

This aspect talks about how well software has the capabilities to adapt itself in the quickly changing environment:

- Flexibility
- Maintainability
- Modularity
- Scalability
