Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. It deals with representing the client's requirement, as described in SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document, into a form, i.e., easily implementable using programming language.


## Software Design Principles
Software design principles are concerned with providing means to handle the complexity of the design process effectively. Effectively managing the complexity will not only reduce the effort needed for design but can also reduce the scope of introducing errors during design.

### software  Architecture

The software architecture of a system represents the design decisions related to overall system structure and behavior. Architecture helps stakeholders understand and analyze how the system will achieve essential qualities such as modifiability, availability, and security.

Software architecture is, simply, the organization of a system. This organization includes all components, how they interact with each other, the environment in which they operate, and the principles used to design the software. In many cases, it can also include the evolution of the software into the future.

- Layered (n-tier) architecture.
- Microservices architecture.


### monolithic architecture 

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. The word “monolith” is often attributed to something large and glacial, which isn't far from the truth of a monolith architecture for software design.

A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.  To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming. 

### Layered (n-tier) architecture

Layered architectures are said to be the most common and widely used architectural framework in software development. It is also known as an n-tier architecture and describes an architectural pattern composed of several separate horizontal layers that function together as a single unit of software

### Microservices architecture

A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

Microservices architecture (often shortened to microservices) refers to an architectural style for developing applications. Microservices allow a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts, with each part having its own realm of responsibility. To serve a single user request, a microservices-based application can call on many internal microservices to compose its response.

### What, Why, and How of a Microservices Architecture

For many years now we have been building systems and getting better at it. Several technologies, architectural patterns, and best practices have emerged over those years. Microservices is one of those architectural patterns which has emerged from the world of domain-driven design, continuous delivery, platform and infrastructure automation, scalable systems, polyglot programming and persistence.


A microservices architecture takes this same approach and extends it to the loosely coupled services which can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Each of these services is responsible for discrete task and can communicate with other services through simple APIs to solve a larger complex business problem.

### Key Benefits of a Microservices Architecture
As the constituent services are small, they can be built by one or more small teams from the beginning separated by service boundaries which make it easier to scale up the development effort if need be.

Once developed, these services can also be deployed independently of each other and hence its easy to identify hot services and scale them independent of whole application. Microservices also offer improved fault isolation whereby in the case of an error in one service the whole application doesn’t necessarily stop functioning. When the error is fixed, it can be deployed only for the respective service instead of redeploying an entire application.

Another advantage which a microservices architecture brings to the table is making it easier to choose the technology stack (programming languages, databases, etc.) which is best suited for the required functionality (service) instead of being required to take a more standardized, one-size-fits-all approach.
